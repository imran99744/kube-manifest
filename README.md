This repository contains the code of the **Kubernetes manifest files** as part of **GitOps Argocd Project**! In this comprehensive hands-on project, I dive deep into the world of **GitOps and ArgoCD**, demonstrating how to implement these essential DevOps practices step by step by **dockerizing** the application and provisioning the infrastructure using **Terraform**.
